FSM using function
ARBITER is as follows: 
When req_0 is asserted, gnt_0 is asserted
When req_1 is asserted, gnt_1 is asserted
When req_2 is asserted, gnt_2 is asserted 
When both req_0 and req_1 are asserted then gnt_0 is asserted i.e. higher priority is given to req_0 over req_1.
when both req_1 and req_2 are asserted then gnt_1 is asserted i.e. higher priority is given to req_1 over req_2.
